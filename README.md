<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tran-quoc-tuan-b338261b3/)

This project is built for application at Dreamerly company. I want to try some new and trending technologies, they really help to build great quality product in an amazing fast speed despite lacking the support from communities. The application was build in 3 days using Nextjs and Firebase firestore. This can provide very great solutions for a fast-paced
startup. 

Here's why:
* The backend and frontend is merged in to one project, the server-side could communicate with clients in an amazing way.
* No worry about database capacity or stability, firebase is backed by Google with great network infrastructure.
* Built with love from a dreamer.


So let's talk about details in the next sector. The man who is able to write a great document could even do better at coding and techniques.

### Built With

Built with NextJS for both front-end and back-end, Firebase firestore for database, Pusher framework for push notification. I tried with FCM for notify but a web service that could handle everything may be never good enough at some specific tasks.
